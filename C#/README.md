# Website-Finder: C#

## REQUIREMENT

[C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com) (Linux users, I advice AGAINST using the Snap Store version)

## HOW TO RUN

To use arguments, you should add " -- " (without the ") before the first argument

```sh
$ dotnet run

# To make the script go through websites with both HTTP and HTTPS protocols
$ dotnet run -- -p http,https
```
